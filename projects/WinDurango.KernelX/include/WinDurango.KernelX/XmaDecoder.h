// One hardware XMA decoder context, emulated with libavcodec's xma2 decoder.
//
// The bitstream the title hands over is a run of 2 KB packets, each opening with a 32 bit
// big-endian header:
//
//     frameCount  : 6    frames that *start* in this packet
//     frameOffset : 15   bit position of the first of them, counted from the end of the header
//     metadata    : 3
//     skip        : 8    packets to step over to reach the next packet of this stream
//
// Whole packets are what libavcodec wants, and whole packets are what the title's input buffers
// hold, so nothing has to be re-cut on the way through. The header is still read, for two reasons:
// `skip` decides which packet comes next, and the position of the first frame is what the shared
// context's offsetRead is reported as, which is how the title watches the decoder's progress.
//
// Frames themselves are 512 samples per channel and chain by a 15 bit length in bits, and one may
// run past the end of its packet and continue after the next packet's header. That only matters to
// the decoder's own state machine, which is why it is fed packets in order and never reset in the
// middle of a buffer. Verified against Media\Audio\FmodAnthem\DURANGO\HZ2_MX_Radio_01_Tracks.bank:
// a packet driven walk runs 3075 frames across 512 packets with no bad length, coming to 32.8
// seconds, which matches the 256 kbit/s the file is encoded at.
